# Basic Nested sampler with ellipsoidal sampling from the prior

sampler:
  nested:
    # Increase for smaller chance of bias
    nlive_dim: 20
    # Increase for sampling weird shapes
    enlargement_factor: 2
    # Stopping conditions:
    # --------------------
    # Fraction of the evidence contained in the live sample ...
    evidence_tolerance: 0.01
    # ... for n iterations
    evidence_tolerance_n: 5
    # Total number of likelihood evaluation allowed
    ntotal_dim: inf
